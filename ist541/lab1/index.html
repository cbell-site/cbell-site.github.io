		     <p>Choose an object that can lie flat. Arrange it on a white surface under bright light. Take a digital photo from directly above the object, and avoid creating shadows if you can.</p>

			Step 2: Create a black and white image.
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> Open the image in Photoshop or another image editor, and create a black and white version of the image. Use the highest contrast you can manage. You want black and white without grays.</p>

			Step 3: Create a transparency.

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> Print or photocopy the image onto a transparency. If needed, you can go to a print shop to do this.</p>
			  <p> If you do it at home, be aware that your transparency and ink need to be compatible. Match an inkjet printer with an inkjet-ready transparency, and a laserjet printer with a laserjet-ready transparency.</p>

			Step 4: Layer the transparency with the sun-sensitive screen, and expose them to the sun.

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> This example uses EZScreen, available at <a href="https://www.ezscreenprint.com/" target="_blank">EZScreenPrint.com</a>.</p>
			  <p> EZScreen creates a silkscreen template using a light-sensitive emulsion. A basic starter kit with a couple of screens and materials to imprint them with your images costs about $48. You can purchase additional screens from the same site.</p>
			  <p> Follow the instructions in the kit. In a darkened room, layer your transparency (oriented backwards) with the sun-sensitive screen. Clamp them tightly between plexiglass and a hard board. Expose them to direct sunlight for one minute.</p>

			Step 5: Wash, then harden the screen.
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> After the screen has been exposed to sunlight, you can carefully wash away the emulsion that was covered by the black portions of your image. This exposes the mesh screen in the shape of your image. Portions of the screen that were exposed to the sun remain covered by the teal-colored emulsion. After the screen is washed, place the screen in the sun again to fully harden the remaining emulsion. </p>

			Step 6: Make a silkscreen print on a wet clay slab.
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> Using the ink spreader from the starter kit, you can use the screen to print your image onto a wet clay slab.</p>
			  <p> Rather than using ink (like you would on paper), you can use slip or commercial underglaze. This example used a mixture of orange and green Amaco Velvet underglazes to create the brown color.</p>

		  <div class="stepImage">
			  <img src="img/seaweed_print.jpg" alt="White clay slab with kelp image printed in brown underglaze. Silkscreen with kelp image underneath." />

			Step 7: When the clay is nearly leather-hard, shape it as you like.

		<div class="stepContent">

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> Once the underglaze dries well enough that it won't be easily smudged, but while the slab is still flexible enough to shape without cracking, you can trim and shape the slab into its final form.</p>

			Step 8: Fire and glaze the piece as you normally would.

		  <div class="stepDescription">
			  <p> Once the greenware has hardened, you can send it to a bisque firing. Then glaze the piece and send it to its final firing.</p>
